# 🚀 Project: Part 2 - Git CLI

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

---

## 📘 Overview

Congratulations on starting your company's journey with Git and GitHub by open-sourcing the Shipping Cost Calculator Python script. All the developers have contributed to the repository, and their changes have been accepted and merged into a new global repository.

Now, you have been asked to edit some of the code and also add a few more files. For this, you will:

- Fork the global repository
- Make necessary edits and additions using **Git CLI**
- Open a pull request

This lab provides you the opportunity to apply Git CLI operations in a real-world team environment.

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to demonstrate that you can:

✅ Fork the upstream repository into your own account  
✅ Clone the code locally in the lab environment  
✅ Create a branch in the repository  
✅ Merge the branch back into the main branch  
✅ Create a pull request from the forked repository to the upstream repository  
✅ Revert a change that you made earlier

🛠️ Let's get hands-on and practice Git CLI operations to collaborate efficiently and contribute to open-source projects!
