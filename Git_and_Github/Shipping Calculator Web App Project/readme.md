# Shipping Calculator Web App: GitHub Collaboration & Version Control Practice

This repository is a part of a practice project to simulate real-world software development using GitHub's collaborative and version control features. The project focuses on building a **Shipping Calculator Web Application** to optimize and enhance supply chain management for a logistics company.

## 📦 Project Overview

The logistics company aims to establish a robust, efficient, and transparent system for calculating shipping costs and providing delivery estimates to its customers. The project is divided into two main parts:

### 🔹 Part 1: Using GitHub UI
- Host the starter code in a new repository.
- Apply open-source best practices:
  - Create a `README.md`
  - Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  - Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- License the repository under **Apache License 2.0**
- Ensure the repository is public and well-documented for community collaboration.

### 🔹 Part 2: Using GitHub CLI
- Fork the global repository:  
  [`Centralized-repository-shipping_calculations`](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/Centralized-repository-shipping_calculations.git)
- Edit the code and add new files using GitHub CLI.
- Submit a Pull Request (PR) to contribute back to the central repository.

## 💡 Project Goals
- Streamline the shipping cost calculation process.
- Promote team collaboration using GitHub workflows.
- Apply real-world software engineering principles.
- Embrace open-source practices for version control and contribution.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub CLI
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (for web application)
- Open Source Licensing
