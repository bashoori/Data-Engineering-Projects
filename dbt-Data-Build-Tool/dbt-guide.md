# 📊 What is dbt (Data Build Tool)?

**dbt** stands for **data build tool**. It is an open-source tool that enables data analysts and engineers to **transform data inside the data warehouse** using SQL and software engineering best practices.

---

## 💡 Why Use dbt?

dbt brings modern development practices like:
- ✅ Modular SQL code
- 🔁 Dependency management
- 🧪 Automated testing
- 📖 Auto-generated documentation
- 📂 Git version control

---

## 🧠 What Does dbt Do?

Instead of writing `INSERT INTO` or `CREATE TABLE` SQL, you just write **SELECT statements**.

dbt compiles them into real tables or views in your data warehouse (e.g., Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake).

---

## 🔧 Example

Suppose you have raw event data in Redshift:

**Input Table:**
```
raw_events
```

**dbt Model:**
```sql
-- models/clean_events.sql

SELECT 
  user_id,
  event_type,
  event_timestamp
FROM raw_events
WHERE event_type IS NOT NULL;
```

**Command to Run It:**
```bash
dbt run
```

**Result:**  
A new table/view like `analytics.clean_events` appears in your Redshift warehouse.
