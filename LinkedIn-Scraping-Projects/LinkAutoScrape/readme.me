## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository & Open Codespace
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-scraper.git
cd linkedin-scraper
```
Then open it as a **Codespace** from GitHub.

### 2. Add Your LinkedIn URLs to `scraper.py`
Replace the placeholder URLs in the script with real profile URLs you want to scrape.

### 3. Add Dependencies
Create `requirements.txt`:
```
selenium
pandas
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Actions Scheduler
Add this file: `.github/workflows/scrape.yml`
```yaml
name: Daily LinkedIn Scrape

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # every day at 9 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-scraper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: python scraper.py
```

---

## 📊 Output
- The script creates a `linkedin_results.csv` file in the repo root.
- Columns include `URL`, `Name`, `Headline`

---

## 📌 Notes
- You must run the scraper **headless** to work with GitHub Actions.
- For full profile data (like work history), login automation or cookies may be needed (⚠️ use responsibly).

---

## ✅ TODO / Improvements
- [ ] Add Google Sheets export via API
- [ ] Add rotating LinkedIn session cookies
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
