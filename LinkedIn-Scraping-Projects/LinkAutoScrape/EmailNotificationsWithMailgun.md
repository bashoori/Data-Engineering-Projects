## ✅ Step 4: Add Email Notification to Your Script

### 🔧 Python Code:
```python
import requests

def send_email():
    return requests.post(
        "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/YOUR_SANDBOX_DOMAIN/messages",
        auth=("api", "YOUR_API_KEY"),
        data={
            "from": "LinkedIn Scraper <postmaster@YOUR_SANDBOX_DOMAIN>",
            "to": ["YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com"],
            "subject": "✅ LinkedIn Scraper Run Complete",
            "text": "Your LinkedIn scraping script just finished running successfully."
        }
    )
```

### ✅ Usage:
Call this at the end of your `scraper.py`:
```python
send_email()
```

### 🔁 Replace the placeholders:
- `YOUR_SANDBOX_DOMAIN` → something like `sandbox123.mailgun.org`
- `YOUR_API_KEY` → Mailgun's private API key
- `YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com` → the email address you want to receive alerts on

---

## ✨ Result:
Every time your scraper runs, you’ll receive an email notification:
```
Subject: ✅ LinkedIn Scraper Run Complete
Message: Your LinkedIn scraping script just finished running successfully.
```

---

## 🔒 Optional: Secure Your API Key
- Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets
- Avoid hardcoding the key if uploading to public repos
