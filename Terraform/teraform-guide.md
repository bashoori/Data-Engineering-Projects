# 🛠️ What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool created by **HashiCorp**. It allows you to define, provision, and manage your cloud infrastructure using simple, declarative code.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Terraform?

Terraform helps you:
- ✅ **Automate infrastructure provisioning**
- 📄 **Use code to describe cloud resources** (like EC2, S3, Redshift)
- ♻️ **Version control your infrastructure** using Git
- 📦 **Reuse configurations** across environments (dev, staging, prod)
- 🧪 **Test changes before applying them**

## 📘 Key Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Provider**      | Defines the cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)                          |
| **Resource**      | The specific infrastructure component (e.g., S3 bucket, Redshift cluster)   |
| **Module**        | Reusable blocks of Terraform configurations                                 |
| **State File**    | Tracks infrastructure Terraform has already created                         |
| **Plan/Apply**    | Preview and then apply changes to your cloud infrastructure                 |

## 🧱 What Can You Build with Terraform?

- VPCs and Subnets
- EC2 Instances, Lambda Functions
- RDS/Redshift Clusters
- S3 Buckets and IAM Roles
- EKS (Kubernetes Clusters)
- Full CI/CD infrastructure

---

## ⚙️ Example: Create an S3 Bucket

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bita_bucket" {
  bucket = "bita-demo-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

Run it:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case: Scalable Environments

Imagine you need to deploy:
- A Redshift cluster
- An S3 bucket
- IAM roles for access

With Terraform:
- You define everything in `.tf` files
- Store it in Git
- Reuse across environments (dev, QA, prod)
- Automate deployment in CI/CD pipelines

---

## ✅ Benefits for Data Engineers

- Rapid provisioning of cloud resources
- Infrastructure consistency across teams
- Fewer manual errors and configuration drift
- Easier rollback and audit of changes
