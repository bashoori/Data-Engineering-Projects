XML is also known as Extensible Markup Language. As the name suggests, it is a markup language. It has certain rules for encoding data. XML file format is a human-readable and machine-readable file format.

Pandas does not include any methods to read and write XML files. Here, we will take a look at how we can use other modules to read data from an XML file, and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.

-------------------------------------Writing with xml.etree.ElementTree -------------------------------------
The xml.etree.ElementTree module comes built-in with Python. It provides functionality for parsing and creating XML documents. ElementTree represents the XML document as a tree. We can move across the document using nodes which are elements and sub-elements of the XML file.

For more information please read the xml.etree.ElementTree documentation.

'''


import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# create the file structure
employee = ET.Element('employee')
details = ET.SubElement(employee, 'details')
first = ET.SubElement(details, 'firstname')
second = ET.SubElement(details, 'lastname')
third = ET.SubElement(details, 'age')
first.text = 'Shiv'
second.text = 'Mishra'
third.text = '23'

# create a new XML file with the results
mydata1 = ET.ElementTree(employee)
# myfile = open("items2.xml", "wb")
# myfile.write(mydata)
with open("new_sample.xml", "wb") as files:
    mydata1.write(files)


#-------------------------------------Reading with xml.etree.ElementTree -------------------------------------
#Let's have a look at a one way to read XML data and put it in a Pandas DataFrame. You can see the XML file in the Notepad of your local machine.

import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree

filename = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/data/Sample-employee-XML-file.xml"

    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())

await download(filename, "Sample-employee-XML-file.xml")


#You would need to firstly parse an XML file and create a list of columns for data frame, then extract useful information from the XML file and add to a pandas data frame.

#Here is a sample code that you can use.:

# Parse the XML file
tree = etree.parse("Sample-employee-XML-file.xml")

# Get the root of the XML tree
root = tree.getroot()

# Define the columns for the DataFrame
columns = ["firstname", "lastname", "title", "division", "building", "room"]

# Initialize an empty DataFrame
datatframe = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)

# Iterate through each node in the XML root
for node in root:
    # Extract text from each element
    firstname = node.find("firstname").text
    lastname = node.find("lastname").text
    title = node.find("title").text
    division = node.find("division").text
    building = node.find("building").text
    room = node.find("room").text
    
    # Create a DataFrame for the current row
    row_df = pd.DataFrame([[firstname, lastname, title, division, building, room]], columns=columns)
    
    # Concatenate with the existing DataFrame
    datatframe = pd.concat([datatframe, row_df], ignore_index=True)

datatframe


#-------------------------------------Reading xml file using pandas.read_xml function -------------------------------------

#We can also read the downloaded xml file using the read_xml function present in the pandas library which returns a Dataframe object.

#For more information read the pandas.read_xml documentation.

# Herein xpath we mention the set of xml nodes to be considered for migrating  to the dataframe which in this case is details node under employees.
df=pd.read_xml("Sample-employee-XML-file.xml", xpath="/employees/details") 

datatframe.to_csv("employee.csv", index=False)
